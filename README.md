# RockAdminTweaks

## Namespacing

All files are autoloaded by ProcessWire's PSR-4 class autoloader. So you don't have to do anything but providing the correct namespace based on the folder your file lives in:

```php
<?php namespace RockAdminTweaks\Foo;
class Bar extends \RockAdminTweaks\Tweak {
}
```
